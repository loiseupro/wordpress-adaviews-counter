# Simple Wordpress plugin to count posts views

This plugin adds a visitor counter in each post.

This counter increments each time the_content Wordpress action is executed.

In addition, in the administrator view you will be able to see the number of visits to each post, both in the list and in the edit page of a post.

If you want to show the number of visits in the frontend, you will have to modify your theme and add a call to the shortcode.
